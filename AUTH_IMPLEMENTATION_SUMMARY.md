# Authentication Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented complete authentication flow with verification routing based on the lustless-server backend and lustless-admin implementation.

## Key Verification Steps

### User Verification States (from server):
1. **EMAIL_VERIFIED** → User completed step1 (email/password signup), needs ID + selfie verification
2. **IDENTITY_VERIFIED** → User completed identity verification, needs phone verification
3. **FULLY_VERIFIED** → User completed all steps, can access full app

### Route Mapping:
- `EMAIL_VERIFIED` → Redirect to `/(auth)/sign-up/step2` (ID photo capture)
- `IDENTITY_VERIFIED` → Redirect to `/(auth)/sign-up/step4` (Phone verification)
- `FULLY_VERIFIED` → Allow access to `/(tabs)` (Main app)

## New Files Created

### 1. `/src/services/auth/use-verification-routing.ts`
- **Purpose**: Hook to handle verification-based routing
- **Features**:
  - Checks user's verification status on mount
  - Redirects incomplete users to correct signup step
  - Prevents access to main app tabs until fully verified
  - `getVerificationRoute()` utility to determine correct route

### 2. `/src/services/auth/onboarding-storage.ts`
- **Purpose**: Persist onboarding data across signup steps
- **Features**:
  - Stores `idDocumentId` from step2 for use in step3
  - Uses AsyncStorage for persistence
  - `getOnboardingData()`, `setOnboardingData()`, `clearOnboardingData()`

## Modified Files

### Auth Flow
**`app/(auth)/sign-in.tsx`**:
- ✅ Imports `getVerificationRoute` and `refreshVerificationStatus`
- ✅ After login (both direct and OTP), calls `refreshVerificationStatus()`
- ✅ Routes user to correct step based on their `verificationStep`
- ✅ Incomplete users go to their next required step

**`app/(auth)/sign-up/step1.tsx`**:
- ✅ Creates account with `POST /api/v1/auth/signup/step1`
- ✅ Saves tokens immediately (user logged in at EMAIL_VERIFIED)
- ✅ Navigates to step2

**`app/(auth)/sign-up/step2.tsx`**:
- ✅ Uploads ID to `POST /api/v1/files/upload`
- ✅ Saves `idDocumentId` to AsyncStorage via `setOnboardingData()`
- ✅ Logs upload success for debugging
- ✅ Navigates to step3 with params

**`app/(auth)/sign-up/step3.tsx`**:
- ✅ Loads `idDocumentId` from AsyncStorage (more reliable than params)
- ✅ Uploads selfie to `POST /api/v1/files/upload`
- ✅ Calls `POST /api/v1/auth/identity/verify` with both IDs
- ✅ Shows **real verification results** (similarity score, extracted names)
- ✅ Calls `refreshVerificationStatus()` after successful verification
- ✅ Updates user's `verificationStep` to `IDENTITY_VERIFIED`
- ✅ Comprehensive error logging to debug upload issues

**`app/(auth)/sign-up/step4.tsx`**:
- ✅ Calls `POST /api/v1/auth/phone/initiate` with E.164 formatted number (+1XXXXXXXXXX)
- ✅ Calls `POST /api/v1/auth/phone/verify` with OTP code
- ✅ Clears onboarding data on successful completion via `clearOnboardingData()`
- ✅ User becomes `FULLY_VERIFIED`

### App Protection
**`app/(tabs)/index.tsx`**:
- ✅ Uses `useVerificationRouting()` hook
- ✅ Redirects incomplete users to correct signup step
- ✅ Only fully verified users can see main app

**`app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`** (NEW):
- ✅ Displays user information
- ✅ Shows verification status
- ✅ **Logout button** that:
  - Calls `POST /api/v1/auth/logout`
  - Clears tokens from AsyncStorage
  - Redirects to `/(auth)` sign-in screen

## Critical Fixes

### 1. Selfie Upload Loop Issue
**Problem**: ID document ID wasn't being passed from step2 to step3, causing silent failures

**Solution**:
- Created `onboarding-storage.ts` to persist data in AsyncStorage
- Step2 saves `idDocumentId` after upload
- Step3 loads `idDocumentId` from storage (not params)
- Added comprehensive console logging for debugging
- Added visual error display on UI

### 2. Incomplete User Routing
**Problem**: Users who started signup but didn't finish would see main app, not be routed to correct step

**Solution**:
- `sign-in.tsx` now checks verification status after login
- Routes to correct step based on `verificationStep`:
  - `EMAIL_VERIFIED` → step2 (needs ID + selfie)
  - `IDENTITY_VERIFIED` → step4 (needs phone)
  - `FULLY_VERIFIED` → main app tabs
- Main app tabs protected with `useVerificationRouting()` hook

### 3. Verification Status Not Updating
**Problem**: After identity verification, user's `verificationStep` wasn't updating

**Solution**:
- Added `refreshVerificationStatus()` call after successful identity verify
- Added `refreshVerificationStatus()` call after login
- AuthProvider fetches verification status on user load

## API Integration

All endpoints now use real production API at `https://lustless-server.nomadsoft.us`:

### Authentication:
- ✅ `POST /api/v1/auth/email/login/initiate` - Initiate login with email/password
- ✅ `POST /api/v1/auth/email/login/verify` - Verify login with OTP
- ✅ `POST /api/v1/auth/signup/step1` - Create account (returns tokens)
- ✅ `POST /api/v1/auth/logout` - Logout user
- ✅ `GET /api/v1/auth/me` - Get current user
- ✅ `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh` - Refresh auth token
- ✅ `GET /api/v1/auth/verification/status` - Get verification status

### Verification:
- ✅ `POST /api/v1/auth/identity/verify` - Verify identity with ID + selfie
- ✅ `POST /api/v1/auth/phone/initiate` - Initiate phone verification
- ✅ `POST /api/v1/auth/phone/verify` - Verify phone with OTP

### Files:
- ✅ `POST /api/v1/files/upload` - Upload files (multipart/form-data)

## Testing Checklist

1. **New User Signup**:
   - [ ] Complete full flow: step1 → step2 → step3 → step4
   - [ ] Verify tokens are saved after step1
   - [ ] Verify ID uploads successfully
   - [ ] Verify selfie uploads and identity verification works
   - [ ] Verify real similarity score and extracted names display
   - [ ] Verify phone verification completes
   - [ ] Verify navigation to main app after completion

2. **Incomplete User Login**:
   - [ ] Create user, complete step1 only, logout
   - [ ] Login again → Should redirect to step2
   - [ ] Complete step2 + step3, logout
   - [ ] Login again → Should redirect to step4
   - [ ] Complete step4 → Should go to main app

3. **Complete User Login**:
   - [ ] User with all steps done → Login → Should go directly to main app tabs

4. **Logout**:
   - [ ] Logout button clears tokens
   - [ ] Redirects to sign-in screen
   - [ ] Backend logout endpoint called

## Debug Logging

Comprehensive console logs added to track flow:
- Step2: ID upload status and saved ID
- Step3: Onboarding data loading, selfie upload progress, verification response
- Step4: Phone verification success
- Sign-in: Verification routing decisions

Check Expo console for detailed logs during signup/login flow.
